## Introduction

> "... each pattern represents our current best guess as to what arrangement of the physical environment will work to sovle the problem represented." [Cristopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) 

> [A Pattern Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language): Towns, Buildings, Construction (1977) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a generative grammar.

> "The empirical questions center on the *problem*
- does it occur and is it felt in the way we have described it?"

> "and the solution
-does the arrangement we propose *resolve* the problem?"

### [The Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

|Problems|Soluctions|
|:--|:--|
| Designing Service Layers | Module Pattern |
| Overly Complicated Object Interfaces | Façade Pattern |
| Visibility Into State Changes | Observer Pattern |

### What constitutes a pattern

+ It solves a problem
+ It is a proven concept
+ The solution is not obvious
+ It described a relationship
+ It has a significant human component

Patterns also give us a common vocabulary

### Types of patterns

+ Creational (new instances of an object)
  - Constructor
  - Module
  - Factory
  - Singleton
+ Structural (makeup of the objects itselves)
  - Decorator
  - Façade
  - Flyweight
+ Behavioral (how objects relate to each other)
  - Command
  - Mediator
  - Observer
