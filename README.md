# Patterns in Typescript

+ Take what varies and "encapsulate" it so won't affect the rest of the code.
+ Program to an interface, not an implementation. Which really means program to a _supertype_.

> **Polymorphism** is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.
