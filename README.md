## Introduction

> "... each pattern represents our current best guess as to what arrangement of the physical environment will work to sovle the problem represented." [Cristopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) 

> [A Pattern Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language): Towns, Buildings, Construction (1977) described a practical architectural system in a form that a theoretical mathematician or computer scientist might call a generative grammar.

> "The empirical questions center on the *problem*
- does it occur and is it felt in the way we have described it?"

> "and the solution
-does the arrangement we propose *resolve* the problem?"
